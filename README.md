## About Me

I'm a developer who enjoys working across the stack—from backend architecture to frontend interfaces. I spend most of my time experimenting with new technologies and building projects that solve real problems.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably learning a new framework or diving into graphics programming.

**Currently exploring:** Anti Cheat, an ia training
